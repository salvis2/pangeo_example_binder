# Example Binder Repo for Pangeo
This is a repo to develop the methodology on how to make a binder from a conda environment and some Jupyter notebooks.

This branch is for a Pangeo notebook, which allows you to spin up clusters and easily access data from AWS.

The project here will be using publicly-available Landsat 8 data, described
